# Google-Sheets-Automated-Reply-using-Google-Scripts

This project was made for a client on PeoplePerHour. The client wanted to send automated replies based on the subscription expiry deadline.
The minimum windows she kept for the mail to be sent between the deadline and the current date was exactly eight days. 
The project is built on Google Scripts which is based on JavaScript. This programming language can be used to manipulate and automate Google Sheets,
Drive and other Google Suite applications.
